## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Founder and Software Engineer** focused on building real-world financial systems — not demos.

I design, architect, and ship **production ready products** ranging from mobile fintech apps to blockchain enabled platforms. My work emphasizes **clarity, scalability, security, and long term growth**.

I think like a founder:
- product first
- systems over hacks
- execution over noise
